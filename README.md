# Family Dashboard

Family Dashboard is a touch-first household organization platform designed for wall displays, phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.

The first milestone provides a responsive PWA shell, an ASP.NET Core API with PostgreSQL persistence, automated tests, and portable deployment foundations. Identity and household backend increments now add persistent households, backend Google sign-in, and revocable application sessions; calendar, task, chore, reward, and authentication UI workflows remain intentionally deferred.

## Repository

- `src/frontend` — React, TypeScript, Vite, and PWA application
- `src/backend/FamilyDashboard.Api` — ASP.NET Core API and EF Core persistence
- `tests` — backend integration and browser-level tests
- `deploy/k8s` — portable Kubernetes/K3s manifests
- `deploy/azure` — scoped Bicep for Azure staging
- `docs` — architecture, development, security, and deployment guidance

## Quick start with Docker Compose

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the development PostgreSQL password.
2. Run `docker compose up --build`.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
4. Check API liveness at `http://localhost:8080/health/live` and readiness at `http://localhost:8080/health/ready`.

The migration service runs once before the development API starts. See [development documentation](docs/development.md) for host-based setup and common commands.

## Current scope

Only health and Google-login initiation endpoints are anonymously usable. Dashboard content is mock data. External services remain their own sources of truth. Full-stack staging is operational: Netlify serves the frontend at `https://family.egobrane.net`, its production bundle targets `https://api.egobrane.net`, and the Azure backend uses private PostgreSQL 18 plus digest-pinned GitHub OIDC deployment and migration workflows. Identity and Household Management Increment 2 is deployed. Increment 3 is implemented and locally verified but remains disabled in Azure until a real Google web OAuth client secret is stored in Key Vault and the resulting immutable backend image is deployed. No Google provider tokens are stored.
