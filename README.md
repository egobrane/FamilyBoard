# Family Dashboard

Family Dashboard is a touch-first household organization platform designed for wall displays, phones, tablets, and desktop browsers.

The first milestone provides a responsive PWA shell, an ASP.NET Core API with PostgreSQL persistence, automated tests, and portable deployment foundations. Calendar, task, chore, reward, and authentication workflows are intentionally not implemented yet.

## Repository

- `src/frontend` — React, TypeScript, Vite, and PWA application
- `src/backend/FamilyDashboard.Api` — ASP.NET Core API and EF Core persistence
- `tests` — backend integration and browser-level tests
- `deploy/k8s` — portable Kubernetes/K3s manifests
- `deploy/azure` — scoped Bicep for Azure staging
- `docs` — architecture, development, security, and deployment guidance

## Quick start with Docker Compose

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the development PostgreSQL password.
2. Run `docker compose up --build`.
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`.
4. Check API liveness at `http://localhost:8080/health/live` and readiness at `http://localhost:8080/health/ready`.

The migration service runs once before the development API starts. See [development documentation](docs/development.md) for host-based setup and common commands.

## Current scope

Only health endpoints are intended to be public. Dashboard content is mock data. External services remain their own sources of truth and no Google credentials or data are stored. Azure staging is provisioned in Central US and available at `https://api.egobrane.net`; Netlify API configuration and the first GitHub OIDC deployment remain pending.
